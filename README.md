# ReverSea

ReverSea is a lightweight, depth-aware CNN for enhancing low-light underwater images. It directly processes raw images by incorporating transmission maps to restore natural colors, improve visibility, and handle non-uniform illumination.

## Highlights
- No preprocessing required  
- Depth-aware enhancement using transmission maps  
- Lightweight CNN architecture  
- Effective in deep-sea and low-light conditions
